Task 1(SDLC Methadologies):

Johann-Teddy Ferreira:
Waterfall model= The waterfall model uses a logical progression of SDLC steps for a project, similar to the direction water flows over the edge of a cliff. It sets distinct endpoints or goals for each phase of development. Those endpoints or goals can't be revisited after their completion.
Agile= Agile Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is the combination of both iterative and incremental process models. It focuses on process adaptability and customer satisfaction by rapid delivery of working software product. Agile SDLC breaks down the product into small incremental builds.

Aviwe Mhlatyana: 
RAD(Rapid Application Development) - This methadology uses rapid prototyping without much planning to kick start the development of a prototype so the developers can know how the app will function.
Spiral Model - Is a method which is used for risk analysis and risk management and it combines the iterative development process model with elements of the Waterfall model.

Dalitso Simukoko:
Scrum- Scrum is an agile project management framework that helps teams structure and manage their work through a set of values, principles, and practices
Extreme Programming- Extreme Programming (XP) is an agile software development framework that aims to produce higher quality software, and higher quality of life for the development team. XP is the most specific of the agile frameworks regarding appropriate engineering practices for software development. 

Hlompho Skhosana:
Rational Unified Processis a systematic way to allocate tasks and responsibilities within a development team that offers best practices and guidelines for effective software development. I
Feature Driven Development (FDD) is an agile framework that, as its name suggests, organizes software development around making progress on features.

Ayabonga Kemese:
DSDM [Dynamic System Development Method] an Agile method that focuses on the full project lifecycle.DSDM has a broader focus than most other Agile approaches in that it deals with projects rather than just the development and delivery of a product
Lean -  a continuous improvement methodology that is a systematic approach to identifying and eliminating waste in processes to deliver more value to customers with fewer resources.

Task 2:

Johann-Teddy Ferreira:
Throwaway prototyping is the process of creating prototype versions of a product, or a single element of a product, to test specific ideas and concepts. With 'throw-away' prototyping a small part of the system is developed and then given to the end user to try out and evaluate. The user provides feedback which can quickly be incorporated into the development of the main system. The prototype is then discarded or thrown away.

Hlompho Lucky Skhosana:
Extreme prototyping is specifically used in web development and divided into three stages, with the second stage being the most important. Critical to these stages are the various layers of an extreme prototype model: the presentation layer or user interface and service layers â€“ communication, business logic and authorization.

The process is called Extreme Prototyping to draw attention to the second phase of the process, where a fully functional UI is developed with very little regard to the services other than their contract.



The three stages of extreme prototyping:

1: Prepare an HTML build to represent the presentation layer

2: Convert the prototype into a fully functional model by connecting it with the service layers

3: Finalize the production by implementing the service layers


Dalisto Simukoko:
Evolutionary Prototyping- In this prototyping the user is presented with an initial prototype. The users feedback is used to modify the prototype to make improvements. In this type of prototype methodology the final product is developed in increments acccording to the feedback from users until the final product is made.

Incremental Prototyping- This type of prototyping can be likened to building blocks. It incrementing each time a new component is added or integrated based on the overall design. End Users and Clients are able to test the developed components and their functions.it also provides the opportunities for feedback while the other components are still in development.

Task 3:

Johann-Teddy Ferreira:
Low-fidelity (lo-fi) prototyping is a quick and easy way to translate high-level design concepts into tangible and testable artefacts. Example: sketches.

Pros= Inexpensive, Fast, Collaborative, Clarifying
Cons= Uncertainty during testing, Limited interactivity

Ayabonga Kemese:
2. Medium Fidelity Prototype adds more details and functionality compared to a low fidelity version. It could involve 
digital wireframes or interactive mockups created using design tools. In the context of game development, a medium 
fidelity prototype of a game might include digital representations of game levels with basic graphics and interactions,
allowing testers to navigate and interact with the environment.

3.High Fidelity Prototype closely resembles the final product in terms of design, interactions, and functionality. It 
often includes realistic graphics, animations, and even functional elements. For instance, if you were working on a web 
application, a high fidelity prototype could involve a fully interactive and visually polished version of the app, complete
with clickable buttons, working forms, and dynamic content.

the choice of fidelity depends on the stage of the design process, the specific goals of the prototype, and the resources available.
Each level has its own benefits and use cases, and they can be used in combination to iteratively refine and improve the design.

Task 4:

Ayabonga Kemese :
1. Figma is a versatile design tool that allows real-time collaboration on design and prototyping. It's widely used for creating
interactive and dynamic prototypes.

2. Obsidian is a versatile note-taking and knowledge management application that aids prototypers in capturing ideas, organizing
concepts, and maintaining a contextual repository for their projects.

3. InVision Studio provides powerful prototyping features along with animation and collaboration tools, making it suitable for creating 
interactive and animated prototypes.

4. Balsamiq is known for its simple and low-fidelity wireframing capabilities. It's great for quickly sketching out ideas and user interfaces.

5. MockFlow - MockFlow is a user-friendly platform that offers wireframing and prototyping tools for web and mobile applications.



Some of these tools have limitations in their free versions or offer free trials with additional features available in paid versions. It's a
good idea to explore a few of them to find the one that best suits your prototyping needs and preferences.
